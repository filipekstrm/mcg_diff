# MCG-Diff: Monte Carlo guided diffusion for Bayesian linear inverse problems

This repository contains the code of the algorithm proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07983 and accepted for oral presentation at ICLR 2024.

This repository can be installed as a python package by running
`pip install -I .` on the root folder of this git.

You can try this algorithm either with the available scripts in this project or in the benchopts, with comparison to other algorithms at https://github.com/gabrielvc/benchopts_inverse_problem_diffusion_prior/tree/master
